## Overview

The ORCATech Learning Platform requires robust backup and recovery procedures to protect against:

- Hardware failures
- Software corruption
- Human errors
- Cyber attacks
- Natural disasters
- Service provider outages

### Recovery Objectives

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: Maximum acceptable downtime
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Maximum acceptable data loss
- **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**: Average time to restore services

## Backup Strategy

### 3-2-1 Backup Rule

Follow the industry-standard 3-2-1 backup strategy:

- **3** copies of critical data
- **2** different storage media types
- **1** offsite backup location

### Backup Principles

1. **Automated Backups**: Reduce human error through automation
2. **Regular Testing**: Verify backup integrity and recovery procedures
3. **Version Control**: Maintain multiple backup versions
4. **Encryption**: Protect data in transit and at rest
5. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed backup and recovery procedures

## Data Classification

### Critical Data (Tier 1)
- User accounts and authentication data
- Learning progress and achievements
- Course content and materials
- System configurations
- Database schemas

**Backup Frequency**: Real-time/Continuous
**Retention**: 1 year + legal requirements
**RTO**: < 1 hour
**RPO**: < 15 minutes

### Important Data (Tier 2)
- User preferences and settings
- Analytics and metrics
- Application logs (recent)
- Static assets and media

**Backup Frequency**: Hourly
**Retention**: 6 months
**RTO**: < 4 hours
**RPO**: < 1 hour

### Standard Data (Tier 3)
- Historical logs
- Temporary files
- Cache data
- Development/staging data

**Backup Frequency**: Daily
**Retention**: 3 months
**RTO**: < 24 hours
**RPO**: < 24 hours

## Backup Types and Schedules

### Full Backups
Complete copy of all data and systems.

```bash
# Weekly full backup schedule
0 2 * * 0 /scripts/full-backup.sh
```

**Schedule**: Weekly (Sundays 2:00 AM)
**Storage**: Primary and secondary locations
**Retention**: 4 weeks

### Incremental Backups
Only changed data since last backup.

```bash
# Daily incremental backup
0 3 * * 1-6 /scripts/incremental-backup.sh
```

**Schedule**: Daily (Monday-Saturday 3:00 AM)
**Storage**: Primary location with weekly offsite sync
**Retention**: 2 weeks

### Differential Backups
All changes since last full backup.

```bash
# Mid-week differential backup
0 4 * * 3 /scripts/differential-backup.sh
```

**Schedule**: Weekly (Wednesdays 4:00 AM)
**Storage**: Primary and secondary locations
**Retention**: 4 weeks

### Continuous Data Protection (CDP)
Real-time backup for critical systems.

**Implementation**: Database replication and log shipping
**Schedule**: Continuous
**Storage**: Hot standby systems
**Retention**: 72 hours of point-in-time recovery

TEST_DB="orcatech_test"

# Create test database
createdb $TEST_DB

# Restore backup to test database
gunzip -c $BACKUP_FILE | psql $TEST_DB

# Run integrity checks
psql -d $TEST_DB -c "
    SELECT 
        schemaname,
        tablename,
        n_tup_ins,
        n_tup_upd,
        n_tup_del
    FROM pg_stat_user_tables;
"

# Compare with production checksums
psql -d $TEST_DB -c "SELECT md5(string_agg(id::text, '' ORDER BY id)) FROM users;" > test_checksum.txt
psql -d orcatech_prod -c "SELECT md5(string_agg(id::text, '' ORDER BY id)) FROM users;" > prod_checksum.txt

if diff test_checksum.txt prod_checksum.txt; then
    echo "Backup integrity test PASSED"
else
    echo "Backup integrity test FAILED"
    exit 1
fi

# Cleanup
dropdb $TEST_DB
rm test_checksum.txt prod_checksum.txt
```

#### Recovery Time Test
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Recovery time measurement

START_TIME=$(date +%s)

# Perform test recovery
./test-recovery.sh

END_TIME=$(date +%s)
DURATION=$((END_TIME - START_TIME))

echo "Recovery completed in $DURATION seconds"

# Log results
echo "$(date): Recovery test duration: ${DURATION}s" >> /var/log/recovery-tests.log

# Check if within RTO
if [ $DURATION -le 3600 ]; then
    echo "Recovery time within RTO (1 hour)"
else
    echo "Recovery time exceeds RTO - escalate"
    send_alert "Recovery time test failed: ${DURATION}s > 3600s"
fi
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Backup Monitoring

#### Health Checks
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Backup health monitoring

# Check last backup timestamp
LAST_BACKUP=$(find /backups -name "*.sql.gz" -printf '%T@ %p\n' | sort -n | tail -1 | cut -d' ' -f2-)
BACKUP_AGE=$(( $(date +%s) - $(stat -c %Y "$LAST_BACKUP") ))

if [ $BACKUP_AGE -gt 86400 ]; then
    send_alert "Backup is older than 24 hours"
fi

# Check backup storage usage
STORAGE_USAGE=$(df /backups | tail -1 | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/%//')
if [ $STORAGE_USAGE -gt 85 ]; then
    send_alert "Backup storage usage at ${STORAGE_USAGE}%"
fi

# Verify cloud backup sync
aws s3 ls s3://orcatech-backups/database/ --recursive | tail -1 | grep $(date +%Y%m%d) || {
    send_alert "Cloud backup sync failed"
}
```

## Best Practices and Recommendations

### Backup Best Practices

1. **Automate Everything**: Reduce human error through automation
2. **Test Regularly**: Untested backups are not reliable backups
3. **Monitor Continuously**: Proactive monitoring prevents surprises
4. **Document Thoroughly**: Clear procedures enable faster recovery
5. **Train Teams**: Regular training ensures readiness

### Recovery Optimization

1. **Prioritize Critical Systems**: Focus on business-critical services first
2. **Parallel Recovery**: Restore multiple systems simultaneously when possible
3. **Incremental Verification**: Verify each step before proceeding
4. **Communication**: Keep stakeholders informed throughout recovery

### Continuous Improvement

1. **Post-Incident Reviews**: Learn from every incident
2. **Technology Updates**: Regularly evaluate new backup technologies
3. **Capacity Planning**: Anticipate future backup storage needs
4. **Process Refinement**: Continuously improve procedures based on experience

## Conclusion

A comprehensive backup and recovery strategy is essential for maintaining the reliability and availability of the ORCATech Learning Platform. This guide provides the framework for protecting data and ensuring business continuity.

Key success factors:
- Regular testing and validation
- Automated processes where possible
- Clear documentation and procedures
- Trained and prepared recovery teams
- Continuous monitoring and improvement

Remember: The best backup strategy is one that has been tested and proven to work when needed.

For specific implementation guidance or technical support, consult the technical team or refer to vendor documentation for your chosen backup solutions.
